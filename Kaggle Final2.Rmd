# Read in the training and testing data

# Feature Engineering
# Example: Extract deck information from the Cabin column
train$Deck <- substr(train$Cabin, 1, 1)
test$Deck <- substr(test$Cabin, 1, 1)

# Missing Value Handling
# Example: Impute missing numerical values with the median
median_age <- median(train$Age, na.rm = TRUE)
train$Age[is.na(train$Age)] <- median_age
test$Age[is.na(test$Age)] <- median_age

# Example: Impute missing categorical values with the mode
mode_embarked <- names(sort(table(train$Embarked), decreasing = TRUE)[1])
train$Embarked[is.na(train$Embarked)] <- mode_embarked
test$Embarked[is.na(test$Embarked)] <- mode_embarked

# Example: Create a new indicator variable for missing values in the Cabin column
train$CabinMissing <- ifelse(is.na(train$Cabin), 1, 0)
test$CabinMissing <- ifelse(is.na(test$Cabin), 1, 0)

# Split the training data into a training set and a validation set

# Remove rows with missing values in any column for both training and validation sets
train_set <- na.omit(train_set)
validation_set <- na.omit(validation_set)

# Build a random forest model on the training set using all the predictor variables
model <- randomForest(Transported ~ ., data = train_set)

# Hyperparameter Tuning (Add your hyperparameter tuning code here)

# Generate predictions on the validation set using the trained model
predictions <- predict(model, newdata = validation_set)

# Calculate the accuracy of the model
accuracy <- mean(predictions == validation_set$Transported)
#print(accuracy)

# Calculate additional performance metrics, such as precision, recall, and F1-score
conf_matrix <- confusionMatrix(predictions, validation_set$Transported)

# Generate predictions on the test set using the trained model
test_predictions <- predict(model, newdata = test)

# Create a data frame with PassengerId and Transported columns
submission <- data.frame(PassengerId = test$PassengerId, Transported = as.character(test_predictions))

# Write predictions to CSV file
write.csv(submission, "test_predictions2.csv", row.names = FALSE, quote = FALSE)

# Check the first few rows of the formatted predictions
